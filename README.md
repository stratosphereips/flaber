# Flaber: A Fast Labeler tool to label Zeek conn.log files

Flaber is a Python tool that reads network flows files (conn.log) generated by Zeek, anlyzes its columns line by line, and inserts new columns with labels based on network analysis information with the best performance possible. The labels that are attached to the resulting labeled conn.log file come from an external configuration file.
